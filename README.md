## Execution:

* Download the colabfile from the above badge or from repo.
* Open google colaboratory on any web browser.
* Upload that ipynb file on that collab note book.
* Upload the dataset file attached in the folder in your google drive and name the folder as prml_minor
* You can see all the code in blocks and their results
* If you want to re-run the code then press ctrl+enter to run a particular block or go to runtime and run all cells to run the whole colab notebook at once.

## Classifiers: 
* Support Vector Machine
* Convolutional Neural Network
* K-Nearest Neighbour
* Multy Layer Perceptron
* Feature reduction- LDA.

## Structure
* Loading the data
* Preparation of Data
* Data Visualization
* Normalization of Data
* Feature Reduction Using Linear Discriminant Analysis
* Built models using SVM, KNN, MLP, CNN.
* We used different methods to increase the accuracy of the classifiers by using grid search over different parameters to find the best parameter and trained the models using those.
* Tested the models
* Comparison between the models mentioned above.
